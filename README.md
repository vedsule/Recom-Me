# Recom-Me
Tired of the same boring generic recomendation's that misinterprete your taste <br>
well no more <br>
I faced the same problem and decided to develop a model specifically for me <br>
but turns out there are a lot of reader out there who liked this project . . .  <br>
## Recom-Me : highly personalized recommendation based on non-generalized , highly user specific context
